# Text Summarization with T5

This project demonstrates how to use the pre-trained T5 model for text summarization. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a powerful NLP model developed by Google Research that can handle multiple text-based tasks, including summarization.

## Features
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses the T5-small model from Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Summarization**: Generates concise summaries from long input texts.
- **Custom Parameters**: Allows tuning of parameters like `max_length`, `min_length`, and `num_beams` for better control over the output.
